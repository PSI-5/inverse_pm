    <h1>In Verse</h1>
    <pre id="poem">
G must have a whirlpool somewhere in her family tree -
the way she engulfs the gulfs, bites at the bights
lochs me in, swallows the quay
to the tangles of her life, the lights

on the rockiest headland, we watch the wind teethe -
gulls goose-step as the waters fold
in self-administered coup. it ceases to seethe
and curls up, mutated, afraid of its own cold

G sees herself contemplating life
and tells me how every genome is in flux, fickle
everything branched and branching in constant strife
before some immortal Darwinian sickle

that all of what we are is four splayed arms -
you, chromatin, fix the color her hair his tone
compress and snip my spirit, my charms
bone shape, heart let to forces unknown
