G must have a whirlpool somewhere in her family tree -
the way she engulfs the gulfs, bites at the bights
lochs me in, swallows the quay
to the tangles of her life, the lights

on the rockiest headland, we watch the wind teethe -
gulls goose-step as the waters fold
in self-administered coup. it ceases to seethe
and curls up, mutated, afraid of its own cold

<b> G sees herself contemplating life</b>
and tells me how every genome is in flux, fickle
everything branched and branching in constant strife
before some immortal Darwinian sickle

that all of what we are is four splayed arms -
you, chromatin, fix the color her hair his tone
compress and snip my spirit, my charms
<b>bone shape, heart let to forces unknown</b>

and constancy is scarce, but G gestures to me wild
tells me about inversion, when these arms upend
some holy order of orders becomes defiled
and traps a snapshot of form, blocks the blend

yes, like the way the wave redacts itself, and caves
G laughs, and reminds me were all once marine
<b>we are part</b> vortex. there is structure, that behaves
how easy it is to stay the same. to regress to the mean

it dawns slow. the pact of pulsing mass that becomes me
some barely-bespoke notch of some eternal genetic slab
like our mothers, we cast our form into some stochastic sea
and learn, cherish and then lose the gift of gab
